## Why These Documents Are Historical

These documents were created during the development and verification process. They contain valuable information about:
- How issues were discovered
- What was fixed and why
- Technical decisions made
- Development timeline

However, they are **superseded by current documentation**:
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** (root) - Current project status and complete feature list
- **MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md** (root) - Current maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
- **INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md** (root) - Current installation instructions

## When to Read Historical Documents

Read these documents when you need:
- Understanding of how specific problems were solved
- Context for why certain decisions were made
