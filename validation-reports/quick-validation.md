# JavaHL Validation Report

Generated: 2025-11-16 11:54:51

## Summary

 **Class Count:** Reference = 92, Ours = 92 (MATCH)
 **SVNClient Native Methods:** Reference = 77, Ours = 77 (MATCH)

## Detailed Findings

### Phase 1: Class Inventory
- Both implementations have exactly 92 Java classes
- All package structures align with reference

### Phase 2: SVNClient Native Methods
- Both implementations have 77 native method declarations
- Method count matches exactly with SVN 1.14.5 reference

### Validation Status
 Class count validation: PASSED
 Native method count validation: PASSED

## Next Steps

For detailed method-by-method signature comparison:
1. Use VS Code to diff individual files
2. Run full validation script when PowerShell issues resolved
3. Focus on critical classes: SVNClient, callbacks, enums
